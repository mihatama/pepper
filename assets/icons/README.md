# PWA Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the Progressive Web App:

- icon-72x72.png
- icon-96x96.png
- icon-128x128.png
- icon-144x144.png
- icon-152x152.png
- icon-192x192.png
- icon-384x384.png
- icon-512x512.png

## Creating Icons

You can create these icons using any image editing software. The recommended approach is:

1. Create a 512x512 base icon with the pepper emoji üå∂Ô∏è or a custom pepper design
2. Use a tool like [PWA Builder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) or [Favicon Generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate all required sizes
3. Ensure the icons have a consistent design and are optimized for different platforms

## Temporary Solution

For development purposes, you can use placeholder icons from services like:
- `https://via.placeholder.com/192x192/667eea/ffffff?text=üå∂Ô∏è`
- Or create simple SVG icons and convert them to PNG

The app will work without these icons, but they enhance the PWA experience when users install the app on their devices.
